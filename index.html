            This page is part of the Lab Work for the Web Application Foundations Course ITMD541.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this course we learn about the core web technologies that
            are integral in the creation of web-based applications. 
            The course covers fundamentals of web
            protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting
            languages. A focus will be placed on writing modern,
            standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with
            HTML and CSS to enable rich user interfaces and communication with
            other services.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and would love to build up on these skills and explore this domain through this course.
